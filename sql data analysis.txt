Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (ID)
ii. Hours = 2052 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643(business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115(business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 9493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537 (User_id)
ix. User = 10000 (ID)
x. Friend = 9415 (friend_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	
	the table i derived is as following :
+-------------------+------------------------+------+
| number_of_reviews | id                     | fans |
+-------------------+------------------------+------+
|                 7 | -7QdOqkajxYzJFiw88a7ig |    3 |
|                 7 | -7lwGMjJ6eObiC7snEBptw |   14 |
|                 5 | -2sK9Q9x-pdg5HbsnZ4wAA |    7 |
|                 5 | -7hOQNAgrR0vdTxUCBpi4A |    0 |
|                 5 | -7nkvmRqbFgoxliR0Xd56w |    1 |

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: there are 1780 reviews with the word LOVE in them, whereas there are only 232 words with thw word HATE on them

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	--list with word love
	SELECT *
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%love%'

	--list with word HATE
	SELECT *
	FROM review

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	No,there is no apparent difference between hours


SELECT stars,hours
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON
      h.business_id = b.id
WHERE city='Las Vegas' AND stars IN (2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5)
order by stars



ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         Yes, the reviews from range 2 to 3 have average 64.5
		 the reviews in range 4 to 5 have average of 130
		 
		 
		 
SELECT stars,review_count,AVG(review_count)
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON
      h.business_id = b.id
WHERE city='Las Vegas' AND stars BETWEEN 4 and 5
order by stars

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
yes, the rating 4-5 have different locations like Southeast,Centennial,Summerlin,Chinatown,Spring Valley
the location of 2-3 stars contains only Eastside

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT distinct neighborhood
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON
      h.business_id = b.id
WHERE city='Las Vegas' AND stars BETWEEN 4 and 5



SELECT distinct neighborhood
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON
      h.business_id = b.id
WHERE city='Las Vegas' AND stars BETWEEN 2 and 3

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The reviews for open restaurants are more then closed restaurants
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The cities are usually different where the restaurant is closed or open
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
--for open restaurants
SELECT *
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON
      h.business_id = b.id
WHERE is_open=1
ORDER BY review_count DESC

--for closed restaurants
SELECT *
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON
      h.business_id = b.id
WHERE is_open=0
ORDER BY review_count DESC
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         The analysis i would do would be sentiment analysis which would cluster Data based on happy key words or sad/unhappy keywords and then rate then accordingly
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                         i choose the data of business and reveiws for this purpose which should give us insights regarding the customer sentiments.
						 Clustering the data into 2 groups can help us deterrmine the working of the retaurants and which restaurant is working good and whihc is not.
						 which restaurant can improve in what sort and which restaurantdoes not need any improvements
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don't even come close to this one. |        |

We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks. |      0 |

The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better. |        |

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful. |        |

|                                   |              |       | The highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting. |        |

I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause.  |        |

It's so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch.  |        |

The steak danced in my mouth. Well not really but you get the picture. The salads and sides (asparagus, potatoes) were excellent. They also have a fine wine selection. This place takes steak on another level! Highly recommended! |      1 |

One nice thing that they did was they did not have enough plantains for both of our plates. So, they gave me my portion and put two on my friend's plate so they could get the meals out. They then brought a side plate with the rest of the plantains when they were finished. It was a well thought out move on the part of the staff. |        |
